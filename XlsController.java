I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that here in India, we have two upcoming public holidays. The first one is on the 15th of August, which is Independence Day, and the second one is on the 19th of August for Raksha Bandhan.

Both Deepa and I, who are part of the L3 support team, will be on leave on these dates. We wanted to ensure that you are aware of our absence so that any necessary adjustments can be made to cover our responsibilities during this period.

Please let us know if there are any specific arrangements or preparations we need to make before our leave.

Thank you for your understanding.
