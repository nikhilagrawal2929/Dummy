Here is the process in points:

1. **Current Workflow (Synchronous)**:
   - Webhook from Messagepoint makes a POST request to PrintSpool API with parameters: `jobId` and `externalId`.
   - PrintSpool service performs the following tasks:
     - Uses `jobId` to call Messagepoint API and retrieves a `referenceId`.
     - Calls Messagepoint API again using `referenceId` to get additional information.
     - Calls the bank core API to register the order creation event.
   - If any step fails during the process, an error is returned.

2. **Proposed Workflow (Asynchronous)**:
   - Webhook from Messagepoint makes a POST request to PrintSpool API.
   - PrintSpool API immediately responds with a `200` status code to acknowledge the webhook.
   - The following process is now handled asynchronously:
     - `jobId` is used to call Messagepoint API to retrieve the `referenceId`.
     - `referenceId` is used to get further details from Messagepoint API.
     - A call is made to the bank core API to register the order creation event.
   - Any errors encountered during the asynchronous process are:
     - Logged in detail.
     - An incident is raised, and error information is noted in logs for further analysis.

This approach ensures the webhook call receives an immediate response while background tasks are handled asynchronously, with error handling done through logging and incident raising.
