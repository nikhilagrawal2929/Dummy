I am writing to request your approval for deploying the changes that convert our synchronous webhook process to an asynchronous workflow. This has been successfully tested in the DEV environment.

We plan to deploy to production on 5th October using the image prod-v5. In case of any failures, we will revert to the previous image prod-v4.

I would appreciate your confirmation to proceed with this deployment.
