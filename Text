Our system utilizes Federated Single Sign-On (FSSO) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to provide secure and efficient user authentication and authorization. When a user logs in via FSSO, their identity is verified by a trusted third-party service, which then issues a JWT containing essential user information. This token is subsequently used for authorization within our system, facilitating secure access to protected resources without the need for repeated logins. The JWT also helps manage user sessions, maintaining seamless access as long as the token remains valid. If the JWT expires, the user must re-authenticate through the primary 2CP portal URL, ensuring continuous session security. Additionally, we maintain stringent request and response security headers to further protect the 2CP
