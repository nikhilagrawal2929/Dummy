**Subject:** Approval Request: Update to TemplateBrandRef Table in PROD

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I request your approval to update the `TemplateBrandRef` table in the PROD `2cp` database.

**Plan:**
1. **Backup:** I will take a complete backup of the `TemplateBrandRef` table.
2. **Update:** I will proceed with the update.
3. **Rollback:** If any issues occur, I will revert the changes using the backup.

The update has been tested in lower environments. I plan to execute this change on [proposed date and time].

Please let me know if you have any concerns or need further information.

Best regards,
