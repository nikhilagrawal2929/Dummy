Users log in through different 2CP portal URLs based on the environment. Authentication is managed by Fsso, and a JWT token is issued containing user information upon successful authentication. The JWT token maintains the session, requiring re-login if the token expires. We maintain security headers for requests and responses to ensure portal security. Users can invalidate their session by logging out. They can then log in again through the main 2CP portal URL.
