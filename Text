I am writing to seek your approval for an upcoming update to the Prod database table templatebrandref. We plan to update the addressformatInD field for the following two templates:

"AM013-Cert Int-Cert Enclosed-3rd Party L"
"AM013-Cert Int-Manual Cert-3rd Party"
The change involves updating the addressformatInD field value from "Third Party" to "Personal".

We are scheduled to make this update on 20th June. In case of any issues arising from this change, we will promptly revert to the previous configuration to ensure minimal disruption.

Could you please confirm your agreement to proceed with this plan?
