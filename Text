As we gear up for the 23 May release, I want to confirm our backout plan. Currently, PROD-v1 is live, and we're moving to PROD-V2. In case of any issues, we'll swiftly revert to PROD-v1.

Could you please confirm your understanding and agreement with this plan? A quick reply would be appreciated.

Let me know if you need more details.
